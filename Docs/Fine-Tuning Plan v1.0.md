## 1. Genetic System Overhaul

### 1.1 DNA Structure
- Implement 16-character hexadecimal DNA string
- Each pair of characters represents a gene (8 genes total)
- First character of each pair is dominant, second is recessive

### 1.2 Revised Gene Traits and Ranges
1. HP Capacity:
   - Dominant: value * 5 + 50 (range: 50-125)
   - Recessive: value * 3 + 50 (range: 50-95)

2. Energy Capacity:
   - Dominant: value * 10 + 50 (range: 50-200)
   - Recessive: value * 7 + 50 (range: 50-155)

3. Movement Speed:
   - Dominant: value / 2 + 1 (range: 1-8)
   - Recessive: value / 3 + 1 (range: 1-6)

4. Natural Energy Loss:
   - Dominant: value / 3 + 1 (range: 1-6)
   - Recessive: value / 4 + 1 (range: 1-4)

5. Active Energy Loss:
   - Dominant: value / 2 + 5 (range: 5-12)
   - Recessive: value / 3 + 5 (range: 5-10)

6. Food Efficiency:
   - Dominant: value / 2 + 1 (range: 1-8)
   - Recessive: value / 3 + 1 (range: 1-6)

7. Reproduction Rate:
   - Dominant: value / 4 (range: 0-3)
   - Recessive: value / 6 (range: 0-2)

8. Gender:
   - Dominant (8-F): Male
   - Recessive (0-7): Female

### 1.3 Mutation System
- 10% chance of mutation per gene during reproduction
- 70% chance to mutate to a nearby value (Â±1-2 in hex)
- 30% chance for a completely random new value

## 2. Environmental Changes

### 2.1 Food System
- Implement maximum carrying capacity for vegetation on each tile
- Grass: Not edible by individuals, regrows every turn up to 10 energy
- Fruit trees: Regrow a fruit every 20 turns, providing 50 energy
- Implement food spread to adjacent tiles

### 2.2 Seasons
- Implement two seasons affecting food growth rates
- Season 1: Normal growth
- Season 2: Reduced growth (50% slower)

## 3. Individual Mechanics

### 3.1 Energy System
- Base natural energy loss: 20 per turn, affected by genes
- Movement energy cost: Determined by active energy loss gene

### 3.2 Reproduction
- Requires two individuals (male and female) on the same tile
- Both must have energy > 75% of capacity (affected by genes)
- Consumes 30% of each parent's energy
- Offspring starts with 50% of the energy consumed by parents

### 3.3 Competition and Fighting
- Implement when two individuals try to eat from the same tile
- Both individuals lose energy
- Loser also loses HP
- Loser forced to move to an adjacent tile

### 3.4 Movement and Pathfinding
- Implement simple pathfinding affected by movement speed gene
- Add "scent" system for detecting food in adjacent tiles (range affected by genes)

## 4. Population Control

### 4.1 Tile Capacity
- Maximum of 2 individuals per tile
- Check capacity before movement, choose another direction if full

## 5. Data Tracking and Analysis

### 5.1 Trait Distribution
- Implement system to track distribution of traits across population over time
- Log data every N turns for later analysis

### 5.2 Population Statistics
- Track total population, births, deaths
- Monitor average energy and HP levels


## 6. Testing Framework

### 6.1 Unit Tests
- Create unit tests for each major component:
  - Genetics
  - Individual
  - Map
  - VegetationSystem
  - IndividualRules
  - MovementRules

### 6.2 Integration Tests
- Develop integration tests to ensure components work together correctly:
  - Reproduction system
  - Competition and fighting mechanics
  - Seasonal changes and their effects

### 6.3 Simulation Scenarios
- Create a set of controlled simulation scenarios to test specific aspects:
  - Overpopulation scenario
  - Resource scarcity scenario
  - Rapid environmental change scenario

### 6.4 Gene Efficiency Validation
- Implement tests to track and analyze the effectiveness of different genetic traits:
  - Survival rate of individuals with specific trait combinations
  - Reproduction success based on genetic makeup
  - Energy efficiency across different genetic profiles

## 7. Environment Configurations

### 7.1 Baseline Environment
- Standard configuration with balanced resources and moderate challenges

### 7.2 Harsh Environment
- Scarce resources
- More frequent seasonal changes
- Higher energy costs for survival

### 7.3 Abundant Environment
- Plentiful resources
- Mild seasonal effects
- Lower energy costs for survival

### 7.4 Dynamic Environment
- Alternating periods of scarcity and abundance
- Unpredictable seasonal changes
- Varying energy costs

### 7.5 Competitive Environment
- Limited resources
- Higher population density
- Increased competition for food and reproduction

## 8. Data Analysis and Visualization

### 8.1 Gene Distribution Tracker
- Implement a system to track and visualize gene distribution over time

### 8.2 Environment-Gene Interaction Analysis
- Create tools to analyze how different genes perform in various environments

### 8.3 Population Dynamics Visualizer
- Develop graphs and charts to show population changes, birth/death rates, and resource consumption

### 8.4 Individual Lifecycle Analyzer
- Implement a system to track and analyze the lifecycle of individuals with different genetic makeups
